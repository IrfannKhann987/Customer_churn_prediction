📊 Customer Churn Prediction
🚀 Project Overview

This project predicts customer churn (whether a customer will leave a service) using machine learning. The goal is to help businesses identify customers at risk of leaving so they can take proactive retention measures  keep in mind that this is trained on asmall datset if you have larger data then you can go for deeplearning techniques that will give some promising results.

I experimented with multiple algorithms, but XGBoost gave the best performance. To ensure fairness in training, I handled class imbalance with SMOTE and optimized hyperparameters using Optuna. The final trained model was saved with Pickle for easy deployment.

🛠️ Key Features

✅ Data Preprocessing – Cleaned and prepared customer dataset for modeling.

✅ SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) – Balanced the dataset by generating synthetic minority class samples.

✅ Multiple Algorithms Tested – Compared models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc.) with XGBoost as the best performer.

✅ Hyperparameter Tuning with Optuna – Automated search for the best model parameters.

✅ Model Persistence – Saved the trained model using Pickle for future use.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy – Data preprocessing

Scikit-learn – ML models & evaluation

XGBoost – Final chosen model

Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE) – Oversampling

Optuna – Hyperparameter tuning

📈 Results

Best Model: XGBoost

Performance: Achieved the highest accuracy & balanced metrics compared to other algorithms.

Impact: The model can effectively identify customers likely to churn, helping businesses reduce customer loss.
📌 Future Work

🔹 use deeplearning techniques maybe a pretrained model

🔹 build a streamlit demo

🔹 Deploy the model via Flask or FastAPI
